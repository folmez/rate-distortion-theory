# rate-distortion-theory
A small project on rate distortion theory that I did in France during Neurobridges 2018

This project followed the work presented in Sims 2016 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027716300750) and did a slight improvement in one of the cases handled in the paper which was presented in Neurobridges 2018.
